# Are those analyses scientifically valid?

> Short Answer: No.

Notebooks in this directory only scratch a topic but don't explore it in detail, and they don't build any serious reasoning about the correlation between ASD and environmental factors. You may use them, but remember that:

> They cannot be used to justify the connection or the lack of correlation between envoriomental/economic factors and autism!

You've been warned.

# Why those notebooks have been created?

> Short answer: They are a core of further statistical exploration (yes, the valid one).

# May I use those notebooks?

> It depends. If you want to use those to prove that the thing X is related to Autism then no, you cannot use them. But if you want to explore the topic further with valid statistical tests then sure, use them.
